bugs:

+ Register Command doesn't increment generated visitor id
+ borrowbook command has a string as a booklist parameter instead of an arraylist of strings

to do:

 + Finish implementing commands
 + Have Visitors automatically depart when library closes
 + Refactoring code
 + GUI
 + redo/undo
 + Employee/Visitor Accounts
 + Concurrent Client Connections
 + incorporate Proxy + State Patterns
 + Support Google Books Web Service API
 + Update design doc


List of stuff that needs to be done on 4/1

+ fix bugs
+ make a thread in the main that keeps calling the getIsOpen function, if getIsOpen is false, remove all visitors that are visiting the library
+ return, pay, borrowed functions


Adam
- return + pay functions ( probably will do more )
